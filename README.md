# ai-assisted-fama-french-analysis
This project integrates **AI-assisted Python programming** and **Stata econometric analysis** to replicate and analyze the classic **Fama/French 5-Factor Model (2x3)** dataset.



##  Objectives

1. Use an AI engine (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to:
   - Download the *Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3)* data from [Kenneth R. French's website](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html)
   - Conduct statistical and visual analyses using Python.
2. Independently replicate the same analyses in **Stata**.
3. Compare results from both methods and discuss any discrepancies.

##  Analytical Steps

For both Python and Stata:

1. **Summarize time trends** for each factor  
2. **Visualize** each factor over time  
3. **Compute descriptive statistics:** mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum  
4. **Calculate correlation matrix** across the five factors  

A brief written report discusses differences between AI-generated results and manually executed Stata results.

##  Outputs

- Line plots showing time evolution of each factor  
- Descriptive statistics table  
- Correlation matrix among the five factors  
- Comparison report (Python vs Stata results)

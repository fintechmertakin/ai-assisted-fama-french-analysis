This Python script, assisted by an AI model, automates downloading of the Fama/French 5-Factor dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, and generates visualizations. It computes descriptive statistics, trends, and correlations for the five factors (Mkt-RF, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA) and saves output tables and plots to the results/ folder.
